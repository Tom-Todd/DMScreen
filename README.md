# DMScreen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tom-Todd/DMScreen.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Tom-Todd/DMScreen)
An application for keeping track of and generating information for Dungeon Masters (DM) in D&amp;D fifth edition. 

## SRD support
It is planned for the application to support most of content available within the System Reference Document (SRD) provided by Wizards of the Coast as well as allowing users to add their own custom content.

## Discord Integration
I hope to add discord integration to the application, allowing the DM to send messages to players involved in the game and dispense resources (files, images, etc). Other possible uses include updating the players with turn information via discord.
